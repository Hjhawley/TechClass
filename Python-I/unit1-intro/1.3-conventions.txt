When writing code in Python and other programming languages, we need to
give names to different things like variables, functions, and classes.
Popular naming conventions include camelCase and snake_case.

camelCase is a convention where each word in a name starts with a capital
letter except for the first word, which starts with a lowercase letter.
For example, firstName, totalAmount, and numberOfYears are all written in
camelCase. PascalCase is a similar convention that also capitalizes the
first word LikeThis.

snake_case is where words are separated by underscores and all letters are
lowercase. For example, first_name, total_amount, and number_of_years are
all written in snake_case. In Python, snake_case is the 'preferred' way of
naming variables, functions, and classes.

When it comes to choosing a naming convention, it's mostly up to personal
preference and the style guide being used. However, it's important to keep
the naming conventions consistent within a project or organization to make
sure the code is easy to read and maintain. Personally I like to use 
camelCase for functions, snake_case for variables, and PascalCase for classes.
This makes it easier to tell at a glance what something is.
