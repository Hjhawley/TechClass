# A variable is a user-defined container associated with a value. When you declare
# a variable, you give it a name (or label) and assign a value to it.
# Variables can be changed or manipulated throughout the program.
# Variables can be of any data type.
# To declare a variable, you assign a value to a name using the = symbol.

x = 42
y = "Hello, world!"
# In the above example, we declared two variables: x and y. We assigned
# the integer value 42 to x and the string value "Hello, world!" to y.
# We can then use these variables in our program by referencing their names.

print(x) # This will output the value of x, which is 42.
print(y) # This will output the value of y, which is "Hello, world!"
# We can also reassign the values of variables by simply assigning a new
# value to their names.

# Python code executes from top-to-bottom. It carries out instructions line-by-line.
# So we can declare a variable, do something with it, and then reassign it later.

x = 10
y = "Roo"
# Now, the value of x is 10 and the value of y is "Roo".

print(x) # This will output the new value of x, which is 10.
print(y) # This will output the new value of y, which is "Roo".

a = 2
b = 3
c = a + b
# In this example, we assigned the integer value 2 to a, the integer value
# 3 to b, and the result of the expression a + b (which is 5) to c.
print(c) # This will output the value of c, which is 5.

# It's important to note that variable names are case-sensitive, meaning that
# "a" and "A" are two different variables. Variable names must start with a letter
# or underscore, and can only contain letters, underscores, and numbers.

# It's good practice to use descriptive variable names that reflect the purpose of
# the data they are storing. This makes your code easier to read and understand.
# For example, instead of using a variable name like "x", you could use something
# more descriptive like "num_apples" if the variable is storing the number of
# apples in a basket.
