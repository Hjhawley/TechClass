# A string is really just an array (or list) of characters, and we can manipulate
# strings just like any other array.

# You can also use "if" statements to test for the presence of a value in a
# list or other sequence:
fruits = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange']

if 'apple' in fruits:
    print("You like apples!")
# This code will print "You like apples!" because 'apple' is in the 'fruits'
# list.
