# Write a Python program that does the following:
    # Creates an empty list called my_list.
    # Prompts the user to enter 5 integers, one at a time, and appends them to my_list.
    # Prints the sum of all the integers in my_list to the user.
    # Prints the largest and smallest integers in my_list to the user using the max() and min() functions, respectively.
