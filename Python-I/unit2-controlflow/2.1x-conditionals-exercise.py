# Write a simple temperature conversion program.
# First, display a menu of options to the user. They should see this:
'''
Temperature Converter
Enter 1 to convert Fahrenheit to Celsius
Enter 2 to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit
'''

# Store the user's input in a variable. Use if-elif-else conditional
# statements to perform different tasks based on the user's input.

# If the user's choice == "1", prompt them for a temperature in
# Fahrenheit and cast it to a float. Convert it to Celsius. The formula
# is C = (F - 32) * 5/9. Print the result to the user.

# If the user's choice == "2", prompt them for a temperature in
# Celsius and cast it to a float. Convert it to Fahrenheit. The formula
# is F = (C * 9/5) + 32. Print the result to the user.

# If the user's choice is anything else, print a message saying
# "Invalid input. Please enter 1 or 2."
