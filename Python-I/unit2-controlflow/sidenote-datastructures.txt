Data Structures

A data structure is a way of organizing and storing data in a program so that it can be
accessed and used efficiently. It refers to a collection of data elements and the 
relationships among them, along with the functions or operations that can
be applied to the data.

Data structures are another category of data types, just like strings, ints, floats,
and booleans. There are many built-in types, such as arrays (called "lists" in Python)
and maps (called "dictionaries" in Python).
