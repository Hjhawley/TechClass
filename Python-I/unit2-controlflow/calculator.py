# Build a basic calculator program. It needs to prompt the user for
# two numbers and an arithmetic operator (+, -, *, or /) and print
# the result. The program should continue until the user quits by
# entering "q".

# Hint: use 'while True:' to loop the program until the user quits.
# Use 'try' and 'except' to handle zero division and invalid numbers.
