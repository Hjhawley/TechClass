# Import and use the 're' module to perform some tasks on this string:

text = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog 123."

# 1. Use 'findall' to find all occurrences of the letter 'o' in the string.

# 2. Use 'search' to find the first occurrence of a digit number.

# 3. Use 'sub' to replace all whitespace characters with an underscore (_).

# 4. Use 'findall' with a metacharacter to find all lowercase letters.

# 5. Use 'split' to split the string at each whitespace character.
