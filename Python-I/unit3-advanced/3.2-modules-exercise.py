# The math module includes the pow function, which returns x raised to the
# power of y. Unlike the built-in ** operator, math.pow() converts both of
# its arguments to floats instead of ints.

# Import and use the pow function from the math module. There are two ways
# to do this: import the entire math module, or import pow from math. Both
# are valid but will require different syntax.

# Write a simple program that uses the pow function on two integers and
# prints the result.
