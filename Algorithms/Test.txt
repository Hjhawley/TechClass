What is Big-O Analysis?
Study of how WORK increases as PROBLEM SIZE increases

Give the Big-O for:
Appending to the end of a python list - 1
Deleting from the beginning of a python list - N
Deleting an item from a linked list - N
Deleting an item from a well-balanced BST - logN
Deleting an item from a badly degenerated BST - N
Traveling salesperson problem - N!
Counting sort - N
Adding two numbers of N digits each - N

Which Big-O category does this code use?
For loop N times
	For loop N times
		Do N^3 work
	For loop N times
		For loop N times
			Do N^2 work
		For loop N times
			Do N work here
Answer: N^5

Linked Lists & Enqueueing
n.mNext = tail.mNext
tail.mNext = n
tail = n

Write Python code for Bubble Sort, Shaker Sort, etc...

Explain the difference between P, NP, and NP-Complete.

Convert the following expression from infix to postfix:
1 * 2 / (3 + 4 * (5 + 6 - 7) / 8) - 9

Evaluate this postfix expression:
24-36+387-*/+

Insert these letters into a BST:
"the quick brown fox"

Delete the "t" and "f" from the BST, in that order, and redraw the tree.
