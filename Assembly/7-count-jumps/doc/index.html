<html><head></head><body><p>Write a RISC-V function with the following prototype:</p>

<pre><code>int count_jumps(int *array, int size)
</code></pre>

<p><code>array</code> is the address of an array of 64-bit integers, and <code>size</code> is
the number of entries in the array (so the total memory used by the
array is <code>8 Ã— size</code>), and all <code>int</code> values mean 64-bit integers.</p>

<p>The function should do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Start with an array index set to the last element in the array
(it will have at least one element). Since array index values
are zero based, this will be size-1.</p></li>

<li><p>Load the element from the current array index, and add the value
loaded to the current index, i.e., <code>index = index + array[index]</code></p></li>

<li><p>If the index is outside the bounds of the array, stop.
Otherwise, go back to step 2.</p></li>

<li><p>Return the total number of array indices visited, i.e., the total
number of values loaded from memory.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>For example, if you were given the array with these 5 numbers:</p>

<pre><code>0, 0, 1, 2, -2
</code></pre>

<ul>
<li>You would start with index 4 (the last valid index in the
array).</li>
<li>You would load the value -2 from the array, and adding that to
the index would give a new index of 2.</li>
<li>The element with index 2 is 1, so you would add that to the
index, yielding 3.</li>
<li>The element at index 3 is 2, so you would add 2 to the index and
get 5.</li>
<li>Index 5 is past the end of the array, so you would stop.</li>
</ul>

<p>Since you loaded a total of 3 values (-2, 1, and 2), you would
return 3.</p>

<p>Note that you should stop when the index is off either end of the
array. An index less than zero or an index greater or equal to size
should end the loop.</p>

<p>You should start by writing clear pseudo-code for this function. Try
your pseudo-code out with the example above (and possibly some of
the test cases from <code>start.s</code>) before writing it in assembly.</p>

<p>Write your code in the file <code>count_jumps.s</code>.</p>
