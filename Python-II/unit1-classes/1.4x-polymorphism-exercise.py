# In this exercise, you will practice implementing polymorphism by creating a 
# base class and several derived classes. You will then use polymorphism to 
# call a common method on different objects.

# Define a base class `Vehicle` with an initializer that accepts the vehicle's `name`.
# This class should have a method `move` that raises a NotImplementedError, indicating 
# that derived classes should implement this method.

# Define three derived classes: `Car`, `Bike`, and `Boat`. Each class should inherit 
# from `Vehicle` and implement the `move` method. The `move` method should return a 
# string describing how the vehicle moves. For example, a `Car` might return 
# "The car drives on roads", a `Bike` might return "The bike pedals on paths", and a 
# `Boat` might return "The boat sails on water".

# Create instances of `Car`, `Bike`, and `Boat` with appropriate names.

# Use a loop to iterate over a list of these instances and call the `move` method 
# on each one, printing the result.

# Task 1: Define the base class `Vehicle`


# Task 2: Define the derived classes `Car`, `Bike`, and `Boat`


# Task 3: Create instances of `Car`, `Bike`, and `Boat`


# Task 4: Use a loop to call the `move` method on each instance and print the result
