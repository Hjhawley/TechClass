Programming II - Objects and Advanced Concepts
This second programming course will give students a deeper understanding of the python
programming language and introduce students to the concept of object-oriented
programming using classes to define objects. Students will also be introduced to
advanced concepts including dictionary data structures, recursive problem solving,
and searching and sorting algorithms. Students will learn concepts by creating simple
games using objects to structure their programs, and creating functions within the
objects using advanced algorithms. Students will also be introduced to basic graphics
programming with objects.
