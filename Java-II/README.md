This is an intermediate course that builds upon the foundational concepts of Python I. It focuses on object-oriented programming, GUI, and modular programming using third-party libraries. Students will learn about recursion, generators, decorators, and modular programming principles. The final project challenges students to design and implement a working chess game using PyGame and object-oriented programming techniques. This course aims to equip students with the skills necessary to build complex applications with Python.
