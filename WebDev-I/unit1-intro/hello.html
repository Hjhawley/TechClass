    What we're looking at here is the foundation of every page on
    the internet. This code is written in HTML, which stands for
    HyperText Markup Language. Think of HTML as the skeleton of a
    webpage; it gives structure to the content, much like how our
    bones support our body.

        <html>: This is the root element of an HTML page. Everything
        that you want to appear on the page goes between the opening
        <html> and the closing </html> tags. It's like declaring,
        "Hey, everything inside here is going to be in the language
        of HTML."

        <body>: Inside the HTML element, we have the body element. The
        <body> tag encloses all the contents of your webpage that will
        be visible to someone viewing the page in a web browser.Think of
        it like the canvas of a painting; it's where you'll put all the
        visual elements of your site.

        <h1>: Now, within the body, we see an <h1> tag. This is a header
        tag, and it stands for "heading 1". There are six levels of
        headers, <h1> through <h6>, with <h1> being the highest or most
        important level. Headers are used to denote the hierarchical
        structure of the content, similar to how a book has chapter titles
        and subheadings.

    When HTML code is read by a web browser, it interprets the tags and
    the content inside of them to format and display them properly. In
    this case, opening this file with a browser will display a page
    with nothing but the words "Hello, world!" in large letters.

    The stuff that you're currently reading is a comment, which is just
    for humans to read and is ignored by the web browser when reading
    the HTML file. I might use more comments like this to explain
    concepts as we go.
