Recursion - solving a problem by breaking it into smaller versions of itself

Factorial
6! = 6*5*4*3*2*1
5! =   5*4*3*2*1
n! = n*(n-1)!   if n > 1
n! = 1          if n! == 1

def F(n):
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        return n*F(n-1)     # Execute an identical copy of the function, using n-1 as the argument.

Towers of Hanoi
Think of it as moving every disc on the stack except for the bottom,
then moving the bottom disc, then moving the stack on top of it.
