The Boolean Satisfiability Problem (or SAT Problem)
Given a set of boolean operations for N variables, check to see if there is a
configuration such that the overall operation will be true.
For example: the formula "a and !b" is satisfiable because one can find the
values a = True and b = False, which make (a and !b) = True. In contrast,
"a and !a" is unsatisfiable.
This is an NP problem. It becomes impossible to solve with too many variables,
but if the answer is already known it can be verified very quickly.

P = solvable in polynomial time
NP = non-deterministic polynomial (appear to be exponential but can be verified in polynomial time)

If we were to solve the SAT problem (if there is a solution) we would by extension
also solve every NP problem, as all NP problems can be mapped to SAT and would be
solvable in polynomial time. In other words, P = NP would be true.
